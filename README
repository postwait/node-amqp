NodeJS and RabbitMQ can be best friends

This is totally not complete at all - you can subscribe to a queue,
but you can't publish or interact with exchanges yet.

See client.js for an example

Part of this code is generated from the AMQP spec. Before using,
you must run:

  rake generate_from_xml

Major TODOs:
- Helper interfaces for receiving messages
- Publish to an exchange
- Test suite
